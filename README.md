# Things I've learned from owning a server

This is my list of things that I have learned over time from owning a server. Feel free to make suggestions, or open PRs if you have more ideas for things that are important. My goal from this guide is to educate new server owners on important concepts.

This guide is very new, so there isn't too much here - but my goal is to expand it over time & add things that I learn

# Section 1 - Server Moderation
- A chat filter is very important. You shouldn't expect all players to follow the rules.
- Stand your ground. If a player is breaking the rules, you have to take action. 


# Section 2 - Server Administration
- DDoS Protection is important. I recommend [TCPShield](https://tcpshield.com) because it's pretty simple to setup, provides good DDOS protection and also hides your backend IP.
- Before releasing your server, get a few friends to test it out. As an owner, I have realised that players are really good at finding every little bug that you don't.

# Section 3 - Server Management
- Have a table (Google Sheets or Airtable works fine) that has the name of the plugin, current version, and the date of the last time you updated. This makes it easy to update in the future.
- Have a to-do list for all of the important things you need to work on.
- If you are creating a complex (or even slightly advanced gamemode), create a short but informative player guide. Commands can be confusing for new players so a guide is always helpful.
- Make shortcut URLs for important things, like your discord server. (example: https://hibiscusmc.com/discord)
- In addition to making shortcut URLs, make shortcut commands in-game! Things like /discord, website, store, map (if you have Pl3xMap) are all commands used often on my server
