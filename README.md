# Things I've learned from owning a server

Here is my list of things that I have learned over time from owning a server. Feel free to make suggestions or open PRs if you have something you think is useful. My goal from this guide is to educate new server owners.

This guide is very new, so there isn't too much here - but my goal is to expand it over time & add things that I learn

# Section 1 - Server Moderation
- Unfortunately, I have encountered a lot of trolls over time. A chat filter helps out a lot with people who like spamming, and I would say that having some filter (even if it's simple) is necessary.
- Not everyone is going to like my server as much as I think they will, and it's just something you have to accept.


# Section 2 - Server Administration
- I've found out that no matter the size of your server, there will be someone who wants to harm by DDoSing it. I recommend [TCPShield](https://tcpshield.com) because it's pretty simple to set up, provides good DDOS protection, and also hides your backend IP.
- Before releasing my servers, I like to have some friends test out new features. A lot of the time as an owner, I miss things that players can find very quickly, which is why having some friends who have not played before test it out is great.

# Section 3 - Server Management
- Having a sheet/table (Airtable is my favorite) that has names of plugins, their current version, and the date last updated is very useful. In addition to this, I also like making to-do lists with detailed descriptions of what needs work. You can use tools like Trello, but I use Airtable.
- With more complex game modes (even a survival server with custom items or land claiming), it's great to have a guide for players. I haven't made a guide for our current game mode, but I will be making a guide in a book on join. 
- Shortcut URLs are great things. I have one so far, which links to our discord. 
- In addition to making shortcut URLs, making shortcut commands in-game is also handy. /discord, /map (if you have [Pl3xMap](https://github.com/pl3xgaming/Pl3xMap)), and /website are three examples of commands I always have.
